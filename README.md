# CalculusCalculator
Going to try to build out a calculator for calculus problems. 
Will start with basic derivatives (ie. exponent rule), then as I
rebuild my calculus intuition I will start adding in chain rules,
e, division, multiplication, integrals, multiple order derivatives 
etc.

# Usage
For now clone and compile with g++. I will create a make file
in the next few days. 

# Design
Each rule/type of problem should have its own file that will 
handle only that type. Going to have to figure out how to determine
the kind of problem and what not. This is a bigger project that will 
take a while. 

# TODO
* Exponent Rule
* Basic set up and design

# Future Goals
* GUI
* Problem recognition to decide what to use
